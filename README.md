Software Test for OneBox

This is a simple Spring app with Spring Web and gradle.

You should be able to run this with any Docker compatible machine, using the command:

'docker build -t e-comerce .' and 'docker run --name e-comerce' inside the project

You can use any API testing tool (Postman, Insomnia) to test the functionality of the app

http://localhost:8080/api/cart/ is the base url, all the endpoints are explained
